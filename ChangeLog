TODO list for viewnup

* Support for config files (aka JIV)
   - example config files
   - with or without a filename (framework style config)
      that would take filenames from C/L
   - #!/bin'erise them so that others can abuse
      them for their own needs.
   - everything that can be done in the GUI can be done
      in the config file (essentially a dump of the
      internal pane representation)
   - XML? maybee? for "styles"

* Realine tab-aware file name input

* Image information (x,y,z,pixel value, voxel value, Left/Right etc)
    will be display in the bottom corner of an image aka most
    commercial radiological viewers.

* Panes will be "minimisable" (yes, I'm an ozzie, I don't use z's)
    (yes there is some irony there)

* Plots of intensity values? aka postf via a sub-window. 

*  remove all gtk_widget_set_usize() calls 
   these should be gtk_window_set_default_size() or equivalent

*  convert dialog windows to real dialogs (using gtk_dialog_new() )

===CHANGELOG===

Tue Mar 25 13:18:58 EST 2003
   * started on viewnup2 based upon GTK2.0
   * removed all automakification/autonconfiscation rot
      this may be put back in later (and may not!)

Fri Apr  4 11:53:52 EST 2003
   * chaged from gtk_signals to g_signals (gobject)
   * began shift from gtkglarea to gtkglext
   * removed all instances (except pane resize) of gtk_widget_set_usize()
   * Removed popt for the time being untill the GTK+ group
       decides upon a C/L parser of choice that will probably be
       incorporated into glib.
